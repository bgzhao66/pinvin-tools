# Fonts

To display all the characters in the Unicode standard, you need a font that supports all of them. The font that I use is [Noto Sans](https://www.google.com/get/noto/). It is a free font that supports all characters in the Unicode standard. You can download it from the link provided.

## HanaMin (花園明朝) font
You can also download the HanaMin fonts [HanaMinA](https://glyphwiki.org/hanazono/hanazono-20170904.zip) and [HanaMinB](https://glyphwiki.org/hanazono/hanazono-20170904.zip), or the latest version from the [official website](https://glyphwiki.org/hanazono/).
